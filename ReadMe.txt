	2.Printing the record, updating the record and deleting the record of each employee
	and giving the user the possibility to find a specific records through his/her ID and Name
	3.Dealocating the memory at the end of the execution of the program by using smart pointers

	deserves a promotion
	4.Use sorting algorithms to give the user the chance to change the order of the employees
	records
